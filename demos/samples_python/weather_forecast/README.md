# Observability

Arch gateway publishes stats endpoint at http://localhost:19901/stats. In this demo we are using prometheus to pull stats from arch and we are using grafana to visalize the stats in dashboard. To see grafana dashboard follow instructions below,

1. Start grafana and prometheus using following command
   ```yaml
   docker compose --profile monitoring up
   ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to open grafana UI (use admin/grafana as credentials)

## Tracing

To see a tracing dashboard follow instructions below,

1. For Jaeger, you can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh jaeger
```

2. For Logfire, first make sure to add a LOGFIRE_API_KEY to the .env file. You can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh logfire
```

3. For Signoz, you can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh signoz
```

If using Jaeger, navigate to http://localhost:16686/ to open Jaeger UI

If using Signoz, navigate to http://localhost:3301/ to open Signoz UI

If using Logfire, navigate to your logfire dashboard that you got the write key from to view the dashboard

### Stopping Demo
